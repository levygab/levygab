- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @levygab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computing, sports....
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying computing in PHELMA, an engineering school in Grenoble
- All the project on this gitHub exept the one named C_project_shorter_path were made in second year.
- Sometime README is in French and sometime in both English and French because this gitHub is recent so I did not have time to change all the README.
- I hoe you will enjoy my projects
