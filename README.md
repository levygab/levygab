- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @levygab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science, Robotics, Sports....
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science in PHELMA, an engineering school in Grenoble
- All the projects on my GitHub except the project called C_project_shorter_path were made in my second year at PHELMA.
- Sometimes README is written in French and sometimes in both English and French.
- I hope you will enjoy my projects
